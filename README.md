# Buenos Aires City Real Estate Prices Prediction Parameter Optimization
This project is a part of the Acamica Institute in Buenos Aires.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to do a parameter optimization of our Decision Tree Regressor. This is a continuation of the Regression project which can be found [here](https://github.com/franalderete7/properati-regression).

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Predictive Modeling
* Machine Learning

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## Project Description
The dataset we'll be working with was extracted from Properati, just like the previus project. The objective is to optimize the parameters in our model in order to get better results and therefore a better prediction. We'll use GridSearch in order to find the best values for our Decision Tree Regressor parameters.
